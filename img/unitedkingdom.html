	    <h2>United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland</h2>
	    <br />
	    <p><b>Language:</b> English </p>
	    <p><b>Currency:</b> Pound sterling </p>
	    <p><b>Attractions:</b> Tower of London, The British Museum, and The National Gallery</p>
	    <p><b>Visa Required:</b> No</p>
		<p><b>Overview:</b>The United Kingdom has more scenery, history, and culture than other places. 
      It is a crowded, odd, and distinctive place; a land of silly humor, tea-and-cake clich√©s, and a thousand and one different personalities; 
      a place where thrusting metropolis like London, Glasgow, and Manchester share map space with the peaks of Snowdonia and the enormous slopes of the Highlands. 
      The UK is made up of four separate countries, and the final product is as complex as that reality would imply. 
      Its general character is as contemporary as it is cosmopolitan, and its arts scene is still among the most innovative and prosperous in 
      the world. Its passions for politics and sports are also quite strong. These days, even the cuisine is delicious.</p>

				<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
				<b>What is the most popular tourist attraction of Ireland?</b>
				<p>The most popular tourist attraction in Ireland is the Cliffs of Moher. 
					These breathtaking cliffs, located on the west coast of Ireland in County Clare, rise 214 meters above 
					the Atlantic Ocean and offer stunning views of the surrounding area. The cliffs attract around 1.5 million 
					visitors each year, making them one of Ireland's most visited natural attractions. Other popular tourist destinations 
					in Ireland include the Guinness Storehouse in Dublin, the Ring of Kerry scenic drive, the historic city of Kilkenny, 
					and the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland.</p>
				<b>I'm going to the Bahama's this summer what type of currency is used there? Are there any customs/cultural traditions that I should know of before traveling there?</b>
				<p>The currency used in the Bahamas is the Bahamian dollar (BSD), where 1 USD is equal to 1 BSD. US dollars are also widely accepted. The Bahamas has a warm and tropical 
					climate, and lightweight, casual clothing is appropriate, although modest dress is expected when visiting religious sites or government buildings. Tipping is customary,
					and a tip of 15-20% is expected in restaurants and for other services. Respect for elders is important, as is being respectful of local customs and traditions, such as Junkanoo,
					a colorful festival celebrated during Christmas and New Year's. English is the official language, and as long as visitors show respect and courtesy, they can expect a warm welcome 
					from the friendly Bahamian people.</p>
				<b>What is the longest plane ride that a human can possibly take in the modern day?</b>
				<p>The longest non-stop commercial flight available in the modern day is currently operated by Singapore Airlines, which flies between Singapore and Newark, New Jersey, covering a distance 
				of approximately 9,534 miles (15,349 km) in about 18 hours and 45 minutes. </p>
